# node-for-log4j
Provides the ACE / IIB / WMB message flow processing node for log4j formerly known as SupportPac IAM3.
It provides the ability to use the log4j logging framework from within your ACE / IIB / WMB flows.

## Description
This SupportPac allows a message flow to log information using the log4j logging framework. This way it is possible to set a log level for each log message and any destination target that can be defined using log4j.

The target as well as the runtime log level can be configured independent from the flow in the log4j configuration file.

## Possible Uses
Use this SupportPac if you need a more flexible logging mechanism than the Trace node provides.
